Module 9 – Capstone: Mini Service Delivery

Scenario
Build a small, production‑like TaskBoard API with:
  ● CRUD + filtering + paging + sorting
  ● Validation and problem details
  ● EF Core + migrations + seed data
  ● Unit & integration tests
  ● Swagger and minimal README
Tasks
  ● Create issues in GitHub Projects; work via branches and PRs.
  ● Add CI (GitHub Actions) to build, test, and run linting.
  ● Write a concise README with setup steps, decisions, and trade‑offs.
Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)
  ● git clone -> dotnet build -> dotnet test -> dotnet run works.
  ● At least one integration test hitting a real DB.
  ● Reviewer approves PR; no TODOs left in code.
